# rasuto
Rasuto is an iOS app that helps shoppers track product availability in online stores and notifies them when items are low in stock or about to sell out. Using web scraping and retailer APIs, it monitors inventory levels in real-time, ensuring users never miss must-have products. Built with SwiftUI for a seamless experience.
